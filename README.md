1. **RegressionModels_CreditCardBalance.R**
   - Utilizes linear, polynomial, and interaction regression models to analyze and predict credit card balances based on demographic and financial variables. It incorporates model selection techniques and split-sample testing to validate the predictive accuracy.

2. **RegressionValidation_BikeRental.R**
   - Applies multiple regression methods such as linear regression, subset regression, forward and backward stepwise regression, Ridge, and LASSO, alongside cross-validation to predict bike rental counts, considering environmental and temporal influences.

3. **TimeSeriesAnalysis_HousingStarts.R**
   - Utilizes polynomial regression and time series decomposition methods (classical and STL) to analyze and forecast housing starts data, focusing on identifying patterns of trends and seasonality.

4. **ForecastingModels_BikeRentalDaily.R**
   - Employs exponential smoothing state space (ETS) and naive forecasting models to analyze and predict daily bike rental counts. It shows how different model settings impact forecast accuracy and includes visual comparisons of predicted results against actual data.

5. **TimeSeriesForecasting_GDPAndHousing.R**
   - Utilize AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, and ETS models, this script explores and predicts the behavior of simulated data, GDP growth, and housing market trends, showcasing various aspects of time series modeling in R with the 'fpp3' package.

6. **Classification_BankTermDeposit.R**
   - Processes and analyzes data aiming to predict whether clients will subscribe to a term deposit. It employs logistic regression, LDA, naive Bayes, k-NN, and decision tree models, focusing on data preprocessing, handling missing values, and optimizing model performance using different statistical learning techniques.
