### 3. **RegressionModels_CreditCardBalance.R**
- **Objective:** Predict credit card balances.
- **Methods:** Linear, polynomial, interaction regression, model selection, split-sample testing.
- **Recommendations:** Incorporating additional data on customer behaviors, economic conditions, and external factors could further enhance predictive capabilities and improve the credit card balance prediction model.

### 4. **RegressionValidation_BikeRental.R**
- **Objective:** Predict bike rental counts.
- **Methods:** Linear regression, subset regression, stepwise regression, Ridge, LASSO, cross-validation.
- **Recommendations:** Focus on selecting significant features to enhance prediction accuracy and reduce computational costs, as different models highlight the importance of feature selection.

### 5. **TimeSeriesAnalysis_HousingStarts.R**
- **Objective:** Forecast housing starts.
- **Methods:** Polynomial regression, classical and STL decomposition.
- **Key Findings:** The data shows a significant trend with housing starts decreasing from 1983 to 1992, increasing from 1990 to 2004, and again from 2010 to 2020, along with a notable seasonal effect each year.
- **Recommendations:** Utilize the STL decomposition model for predicting housing starts due to its superior performance in capturing trends and seasonality.
